# 🛡️ Global Digital Wildlife Protection Framework (Draft v1.0)

**Author:** Linfang Yang (Meta engineer · Cheetah Conservation Fund & ACK volunteer since 2017)
**Date:** May 29, 2025
**Focus:** Cross-platform enforcement policy & action model to combat digital wildlife trafficking, especially focused on cheetah cubs

---

## 🌍 Core Principles

1. **Wildlife Are Not Pets**
   All wild animals—regardless of endangered status—deserve protection from exploitation and commodification.

2. **Prohibit Human-Wildlife Contact Content**
   Posts showing humans hugging, kissing, bottle-feeding, or posing with wild animals promote unsafe behavior and must be restricted.

3. **Intent Does Not Justify Exposure**
   Even "good intentions" (rehabilitation, education) must not normalize captivity or proximity when misinterpreted out of context.

4. **Respect the Wild Young**
   All cubs—wild or domestic—represent future ecosystems. Their removal fractures ecological and emotional continuity.

5. **Mutual Trust, Not Ownership**
   Wildlife relationships must be based on mutual trust, not ownership or display.

6. **Harmonization with Law**
   Align platform enforcement with CITES, local trafficking laws, and conservation NGO standards (e.g. CCF, TRAFFIC, IFAW).

## 🛠️ Platform Action Recommendations

### 📷 Content Moderation Tools

* **AI-Powered Detection**: CV & NLP systems trained to flag:

  * Cheetah cubs in domestic or commercial environments
  * Keywords: “exotic pet”, “cheetah for sale”, emoji code, luxury wildlife
  * Suspicious patterns: repeated cub postings, private breeder group activity

* **Human Moderation Queues**: Wildlife-specialized human moderators to assess edge cases flagged by AI

### 📣 Reporting Infrastructure

* One-click "Report Wildlife Trafficking" button
* Anonymous + urgent report option for whistleblowers
* User gets feedback on investigation result (if permitted by law)

### 🧠 User Education Overlays

* Auto-overlay on wildlife-related posts with:

  * “This species is protected by law”
  * “Wild animals are not pets – Learn more”

### 🗂️ Creator Guidelines & Enforcement

* Uploaders required to self-disclose:

  * Wild animal in video/photo?
  * Location? Captive or wild?
  * Permitted by sanctuary or law?

* Non-disclosure = content shadowbanned + flagged for review

### 🤝 Cross-Sector Collaboration

* NGO API Feed: Partner orgs submit flagged trafficking trends
* Wildlife trafficking keyword database updated weekly
* Shared intelligence with Interpol, CITES enforcement units

## 📅 Children’s Day Campaign · June 1: "Protect the Wild Young"

### 🎯 Goal

Raise global awareness of wildlife baby trafficking—especially cheetah cubs—and its emotional, ecological, and legal consequences.

### 🔧 Campaign Features

* Stories of orphaned cubs

## 🐾 Field Reference: Wildlife Lost = Function Broken

Each cub stolen breaks:

* Predator-prey balances
* Genetic diversity of future generations
* Cultural lineage of wild animal communities

**Loss is not symbolic. It’s structural.**

## 🧭 Closing Note

> “Life on Earth must be treated as local gods—each species a keystone in the living system. You do not turn gods into pets. You protect them so the world keeps breathing.”

This document is the beginning of a scalable, enforceable policy to protect wild souls—both human and non-human.

**Prepared for internal & partner use. Drafting support available for external roll-out.**
