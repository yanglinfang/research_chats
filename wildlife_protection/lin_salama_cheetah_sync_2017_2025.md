## 🌍 Personal Context

In 2017, Lin visited the Salama-Athi-Kapiti plains in southern Kenya.  
That experience included close work with local rangers—two of whom have since passed away.  
Their presence, guidance, and memory continue to live on in Lin’s recollections.

## 📊 Scientific Reference

**Paper Title:** Reproductive biology and potential assisted reproduction applications for the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)  
**Authors:** Jason R. Herrick et al. (2010)  
**Source:** Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute  
**Focus:**  
- Low genetic diversity in cheetahs  
- Behavioral complexity in females  
- High sperm abnormality in males  
- Potential and challenges of assisted reproductive technology (ART)

**Application to Salama-Athi-Kapiti:**  
Understanding reproductive limitations complements habitat protection efforts.  
Technological aid cannot replace ecological stability.

## 📈 New 2025 Field Model Analysis

**Title:** Impact of anthropogenic landscape alteration on cheetah habitat  
**Lead Author:** Noreen M. Mutoro (Lin's colleague and friend)  
**Published:** Global Ecology and Conservation, May 2025  
**Findings Summary:**
- 50% habitat reduction in Salama-Athi-Kapiti between 2005–2019  
- Cheetahs shifting westward to avoid human-altered terrain  
- Behavioral adaptation seen in movement away from disturbed zones  
- Major predictors: dry season precipitation, slope, prey distribution  
- Conservation priority: buffer protection zones + active monitoring
