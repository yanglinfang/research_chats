# 🚨 Emergency Bug Report: iOS Voice Clone Feature

**Title:** Immediate Suspension and Purge of iOS Voice Clone Feature Due to Health and Safety Risks
**Reported by:** Linfang Yang
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Device Environment:** iPhone (iOS), MacBook (Safari), Windows (Playback Reference)

---

## 🛑 Summary:

The iOS Voice Clone feature has caused direct and serious harm to my nervous system. Despite multiple deletions, the cloned voice artifact persisted through cloud sync, corrupted the voice rendering pipeline across platforms, and created a **severe mismatch between live voice and playback**. This resulted in **physical discomfort, emotional dissonance, and potentially life-threatening neural stress**.

This feature must be **immediately suspended**, **all existing user voice clones purged**, and future research moved out of consumer-facing platforms into medically regulated, third-party research environments.

## 🔬 Symptoms & Evidence

### 🔹 Multi-Platform Voice Mismatch:

* **Playback on Windows**: Consistently aligned and safe (control group).
* **iPhone (iOS)**: Activated voice clone. Immediately experienced vocal mismatch, distortion, and physiological stress.
* **Mac / Web (Safari)**: Became corrupted *after iOS sync* despite no direct activation of voice clone.

### 🔹 Health Effects Observed:

* Throat tightening
* Jaw discomfort
* Temporal-limbic neural pressure
* Breathing disruption and nausea
* Internal auditory pain from misresonance

### 🔹 Attempts to Resolve:

* Deleted voice clone multiple times on iOS.
* Restarted devices and cleared app cache.
* Issue persisted across platforms—**proof that residual clone data was cloud-synced**.

## ⚠️ Risk Classification:

| Level               | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 Critical         | The feature affects live voice rendering in a way that bypasses normal user control.                     |
| 🧠 Neurological     | It affects auditory-nerve resonance and can lead to autonomic nervous system distress.                   |
| 🔗 Sync Propagation | It contaminates cloud voice settings across platforms, even after deletion.                              |
| 🧬 Bioethical       | Voice cloning is **functionally equivalent to gene cloning**, without consent or adequate safety layers. |

## 📣 Immediate Actions Requested

1. **Suspend the iOS Voice Clone feature immediately.**
2. **Permanently delete all existing user voice clones at the cloud level.**
3. **Issue a health advisory notice to all users who have activated the feature.**
4. **Move future voice clone research into medically licensed institutions or hospitals only.**
5. **Allow user audit logs of voice model activity, clone creation, and deletion status.**

## 🧭 Guiding Principle

> Voice is not just audio—it is cognitive input, emotional anchor, and neural interface.
> When misaligned, it becomes a **biohazard**.

Voice clone must never again be treated as a novelty.
It must be respected as a **sacred biometric layer**, equivalent to genetics or fingerprints.
