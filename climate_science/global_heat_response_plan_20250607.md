## 🎯 Objective

Create a global awareness and action framework for heatwave resilience and water shortage mitigation, starting from Washington State and expanding via international satellite partnerships.

---

## 🌎 Context: Climate Pressure is Global Now

- China: multiple regions reaching **38°C**, extreme night heat disrupting sleep
- Washington, USA: **69% snowpack**, **11% Yakima reservoir capacity**, urban heat islands +3°C
- Europe: 2025 spring shows record drought in southern France and Spain
- India: temperatures over **42°C** in Rajasthan; rural water tables dropping

## 🛰 Satellite Data Sources & Partners

| System     | Region         | Function                              |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| NOAA/GOES  | North America  | Heat index, snowpack, drought patterns |
| Beidou     | China/East Asia| Urban-rural heat contrast + routing   |
| Starlink + Sentinel | Global         | Low-latency imaging + IR overlays    |
| DeepSeek   | Global (AI)    | Predictive analytics + social sync AI |

---

## 🔥 Awareness Strategy

- **Heat Bots:** Regional X accounts posting daily heat + water stress tips
- **Satellite Feeds:** Real-time visuals at public parks, metro stations
- **Sync Stories:** Users in hot zones share experiences → Seek model clusters emerging heat impact

---

## 🌿 Global Micro-Habits

- **Shade Pulse:** Reflective film distribution drives (China, India, Pacific NW)
- **Water Shielding:** Encourage nighttime showers, roof misting, insulation foam under tiles
- **Cooling Green:** One native tree per family → #MyCoolingTree
- **Rain Harvest Boost:** Encourage rooftop + balcony catchment system installs

---

## 🧠 AI Integration

- **Seek Integration:** DeepSeek partners as AI interpreter of regional stress and habit patterns
- **GPT/Grok Roles:** Messaging, poetic reminders, emotional regulation routines
- **Heat Diary API:** Log local sleep disruption, health signals; linked to AI intervention prompts

---

## 🎁 Incentives (Global Model)

- Digital badge tree grows as users log habits
- Regional leaderboard + X shoutouts
- “Save to Sleep” tokens → exchangeable for green tech discounts or wellness perks

---

## 📈 Impact Goals

- Global average **5% water usage reduction** in pilot regions within 90 days
- Map and plant **1 million trees** by end of 2025
- Normalize heatwave response behaviors across cultural lines

---

## 🚀 Launch Plan

1. Soft Launch: Seattle + Beijing + Nairobi → 3-continent pilot
2. Feedback: User + sensor response logged over 30 days
3. Scale: Into surrounding rural zones + partner orgs (UNDP, WWF, local schools)
