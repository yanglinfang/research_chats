### Public Communication Enhancements

* Distribute energy-saving guidance via broadcast and digital media.
* Incorporate audio cues for public alerts to improve compliance and reduce panic.

## Executive Summary (Condensed)

Chicago faces increasing climate threats—particularly extreme heat and precipitation—that compound urban heat island effects and threaten grid reliability. This strategy integrates:

* **Emergency cooling centers + sensor monitoring**
* **Real-time public alerts & behavioral energy guidance**
* **AI-enhanced load forecasting**
* **Microgrids + flood-hardened substations + advanced transformers**
* **Community-driven mapping and engagement tools**

These approaches are designed for replication and implementation across similar urban environments confronting energy strain under climate volatility.
