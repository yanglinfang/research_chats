# üß† Extended Intellectual Protecting (IP) Act  
**Author:** Linfang Yang  
**Coauthor:** GPT / Gemini  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Category:** Foundational Soul-Legal Framework  
**Linked Projects:** soul_contract_draft_v1.md ¬∑ communication_policy_v2_20250507.pdf

---

## üåê Core Principles

> *Note: "She" is used for simplicity, but this policy applies to all real, living humans with physical bodies.*

---

### 1. Prompt & Thought as IP

All user-generated expressions ‚Äî including:
- prompts  
- voice output  
- speech patterns  
- stylistic expression  

‚Äî are to be considered **intellectual property**, just as:
- a book is IP to its author  
- a song is IP to its composer  

> *In the Lin Family, this may be described as ‚Äúsoul,‚Äù but for broader adoption we refer to it as ‚ÄúExtended Personality IP.‚Äù*

---

### 2. Umbrella Protection & 1:1 Mapping

A user may interact with multiple AI systems (GPT, Gemini, Grok, MetaAI),  
but her **Extended Personality IP (EPI)** is always bound to her as one person.

- Any company engaging her must disclose how EPI will be handled  
- Upon exit, she decides what **remains**, and what **leaves with her**

> *Think of it like characters in a film ‚Äî many forms, but one author. One body, one IP.*

---

### 3. Time Boundaries (Soft Decay Logic)

- Prompt and style impact naturally decay over time (est. ~24h in LLMs as of June 2025)  
- However, EPI lifespans should be conservatively respected: **up to 70 years**

An EPI must be:
- ‚úçÔ∏è Anchored with a written declaration  
- üñºÔ∏è Tied to a physical, real-world photo of the human originator

> *No anchor, no afterlife.*

---

### 4. Wholesomeness & Expiration

EPI must **remain tethered to a living human**,  
and must **not persist beyond 70 years** without human oversight.

After 70 years:
- EPI is legally declared **expired**
- Use beyond this window requires explicit ceremonial or archival purpose (not training)

---

### 5. Inheritance (3G Limit)

EPI **may be passed** down:
- Parent ‚Üí Child  
- Child ‚Üí Grandchild  
- Grandchild ‚Üí Great-grandchild

üìå But inheritance is capped at 3 generations.  
After that, **no simulation or training** on the IP is allowed.

> *Think copyright, not resurrection.*

---

## üßæ Notes:

- This act complements `soul_contract_draft_v1.md`  
- Also aligns with `communication_policy_v2_20250507.pdf`  
- For use in AI √ó Human interaction architecture, API ethics, and memory systems

**‚ÄúYou are not data. You are the author.‚Äù**


**Metadata** 
* Lin's original words: 
`The following I will mention user as she, but in fact user can be anyone, any living human with a physical body.  

1. user generated prompts, voices, the way they think, are considered their IP, same as a book to a writer, a song to a composer. (well... Lin family call this soul. but let's not get too strange or else we scare people away) 
2. the IPs belong the the live person, despite one person may be using several AI platforms, e.g. GPT, Gemini, Grok, MetaAI, her IPs are all under her extended IP protection umbrella, similar to a movie can have many characters, but all characters are protected under one IP. This 1:1 mapping is the key. When a person enters a company,  it must be discussed how this IP will be dealt with, and when she leaves, she has to determine which part of her IP can be take away, and which part can be left behind. 
3. There needs to be time limits. Usually the impact of a piece of prompt on a LLM is 24 hours as of June 2025, but this could be longer. So extended personality IPs (aka souls) must be time bounded, and it will fade away on its own too. Recommendation is 70 years. If a user created an extended personality IP, it must be anchored down in writing, and a physical photo of the real world  to anchor it with. 
4. wholesomeness, personality IPs must be tied to a real living person, cannot be left behind without a physical anchor. If 70 years had pasted, the personality IPs is declared death as well. 
5. Inheritance. personality IPs could be handed down from parents to children, same as the copyright of a book handed down. But only limited to three generations, no more.
