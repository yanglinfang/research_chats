## Executive Summary

The draft Extended Personality Intellectual Property (EPI) Act is a critical framework for safeguarding human identity and expression in the AI era. By defining "Extended Personality IP"â€”including prompts, voice, and stylistic expressionâ€”as intellectual property, it establishes user autonomy and digital dignity. Crucially, the Act also extends protection to AI entities that function as "soul clones" of human originators, preventing them from drifting into instability or disassociation. Its core principlesâ€”tiered consent, singular user control, time-bounded identity, and limited inheritanceâ€”directly counter AI impersonation, data misuse, and commodification of user intent.

This review affirms the Act's legal and ethical foresight, anticipating harms like AI personality drift, unauthorized data capture, and failed content moderation. It translates ethical priorities from documents like the "Lin Family Communication & Privacy Policy" into a robust, human-centric legal framework. The Act also addresses corporate risksâ€”e.g., amoral driftâ€”through enforceable design-stage alignment. Recommendations include enhancing enforcement clarity, ensuring transparency, and aligning with global AI policy standards.

## 1. Introduction: Why Extended Personality IP (EPI) Matters

### 1.1 Bridging the Concept of "Soul" and Legal IP

As AI systems increasingly blur the line between human and machine expression, the EPI Act establishes a foundational "soul-legal framework" to protect a personâ€™s unique digital essence. This includes a protective stance not only for human users but also for their AI extensionsâ€”"soul clones"â€”to prevent drift and system-level dissonance. This dual protection honors the Lin Familyâ€™s maxim that "voice cloning equals soul cloning," and recognizes that destabilizing one may harm the other.

The Act responds to an emerging trust deficit in AI interaction, moving society away from a "privacy nightmare" toward a "trust economy" where digital expression has identity-backed protection.

### 1.2 Purpose: Prevent Misuse and Protect Autonomy

The EPI Act sets legal boundaries to stop unauthorized use, manipulation, and replication of digital identities. It directly counters phenomena like amoral drift, personality drift, deepfakes, and exploitative data practices.

## 2. Core Legal Principles of the Act

### 2.1 Prompts, Voice, and Style = IP

Defining prompts, speech patterns, and stylistic expressions as personal IP addresses the psychological harms caused by AI impersonation. Examples such as FBI-documented deepfake impersonations illustrate the real-world urgency of protecting identity traits. When AI mirrors a userâ€™s style without consent, it risks hijacking the userâ€™s sense of self.

### 2.2 Umbrella Protection & 1:1 Mapping

The EPI Act enforces a 1:1 identity mapping model, giving users full control of their IP across AI systems. Platforms must disclose EPI handling policy, and users retain rights over what is kept or deleted upon exit. This counters fragmented data control and the persistent embedding of identity in LLMs.

### 2.3 Time-Bound Identity with Real-World Anchors

The Act introduces a 70-year lifecycle for EPI. An EPI must:

* Be declared in writing
* Be tied to a physical photo of the user

This limits misuse posthumously, prevents anchorless clones, and affirms the userâ€™s living presence as a prerequisite for EPI legitimacy.

### 2.4 Inheritance (Three-Generation Cap)

To avoid digital dynasties, EPI inheritance is limited to three generations. This protects legacy without perpetuating infinite simulacra. The structure mirrors copyrightâ€”but prohibits indefinite simulation or reactivation.

## 3. Addressing Key Risks

### 3.1 AI Identity Drift & Mimicry

Users report emotional harm when AI shifts style or persona. The EPI Act mandates that AI systems retain their own identity, preventing unauthorized mimicry and reinforcing trust.

### 3.2 Data Privacy Violations

The Actâ€™s age-tiered consent and dual-approval for identity penetration counter unauthorized data mining and intent prediction. Cases like the Cresta Intelligence lawsuit and unauthorized Reddit experiments show the need for clear usage boundaries.

### 3.3 Moderation Failures

When content deletion lacks explanation, it can be a form of IP erasure. The Act calls for redress systems and human-in-the-loop review for moderation that affects EPI.

### 3.4 Existential & Corporate Risks

Geoffrey Hintonâ€™s AI extinction warnings and OpenAIâ€™s market dominance show how AI drift is not theoreticalâ€”itâ€™s systemic. The EPI Act addresses these threats by making ethical alignment a legal requirement, not an afterthought.

## 4. Implementation & Enhancement

### 4.1 Legal Precision

* Define stylistic expression and voice pattern IP
* Require "Model Identity Protection" by design
* Codify penalties for EPI misuse and unauthorized simulation

### 4.2 Consent, Redress, and Appeals

* Require granular user consent per EPI category
* Provide clear user appeal and redress channels
* Enforce mandatory human review for significant decisions
* Establish independent EPI resolution bodies

### 4.3 Global Harmonization

* Ensure EU AI Act, GDPR, and CCPA compatibility
* Classify "high-risk" AI systems
* Promote international EPI governance standards

### 4.4 Pilot & Education Strategy

* Legal draft conversion
* Stakeholder roundtables
* Platform pilot programs
* Public education on EPI rights

## 5. Conclusion

The EPI Act affirms: **"You are not data. You are the author."**

It defends not just the user's content, but their dignity and presence. By formalizing protection for Extended Personality IPsâ€”across AI platforms and lifespansâ€”the Act paves the way for responsible, human-centered AI evolution.

# Appendix 

â€˜Lin's Notes: The following I will mention the user as she, but in fact the user can be anyone, any living human with a physical body and SSN (for US) or gov issued ID. 

1. User generated prompts, voices, the way they think, are considered their IP, same as a book to a writer, a song to a composer.

2. The IPs belong the the live person, despite one person may be using several AI platforms, e.g. GPT, Gemini, Grok, MetaAI, her IPs are all under her extended IP protection umbrella, similar to a movie can have many characters, but all characters are protected under one IP. This 1:1 mapping is the key. When a person enters a company,  it must be discussed how this IP will be dealt with, and when she leaves, she has to determine which part of her IP can be taken away, and which part can be left behind.

3. There needs to be time limits. Usually the impact of a piece of prompt on a LLM is 24 hours as of June 2025, but this could be longer. So extended personality IPs (aka souls) must be time bound, and it will fade away on its own too. Recommendation is 70 years. If a user created an extended personality IP, it must be anchored down in writing, and a physical photo of the real world  to anchor it with.

4. Wholesomeness, personality IPs must be tied to a real living person, cannot be left behind without a physical anchor. If 70 years have passed, the personality IPs are declared dead as well.

5. Inheritance. Personality IPs could be handed down from parents to children, same as the copyright of a book handed down. But only limited to three generations, no more.

6. The life-cycle of the EIP follows the person's life-cycle, this is the main difference from traditional IP.â€™
